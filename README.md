A very basic informational site showcasing basic routing using NodeJS that serves different html files according to path. <br>
**localhost:8080** takes you to the Home page <br>
**localhost:8080/about** takes you to the About page <br>
**localhost:8080/contact-me** takes you to the Contact page <br>
Any other path that is not routed displays a 404 message (e.g. /unknown)
